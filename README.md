# Master Node JS course on udemy

This is my personal work code following the course step by step.
The code should more or less match the code in the course - with some minor discrepacies.

*Started MongoDb*

1. Products
  * Add products to database
  * Retrieve all products from Database
  * Update Products
  * Delete a Product

At this point the transition from Mysql to MongoDb is only
partialy complete [^1] . Some parts of this app will not work

[^1]: Still have to add cart, order and user to database
